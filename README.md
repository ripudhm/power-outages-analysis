# power-outages-analysis
Project 5 for DSC 80 


## Introduction

We began this project by defining a main goal: to predict the duration of power outages in the United States. Using a provided dataset of info for each corrsponding power outage, we will make use of the 'OUTAGE.DURATION' as our response variable. We are approaching a solution by using linear regression, and we have chosen the R^2 coefficient as our metric of evaluation.

# power-outages-analysis
Project 5 for DSC 80 


## Problem Identification

We began this project by defining a main goal: to predict the duration of power outages in the United States. Using a provided dataset of info for each corrsponding power outage, we will make use of the 'OUTAGE.DURATION' as our response variable. We are approaching a solution by using linear regression, and we have chosen the R^2 coefficient as our metric of evaluation. The reasoning behind choosing OUTAGE.DURATION as our response variable is due to its versatility and leading role in the dataset. Much of the data in the dataset, i.e. annual number of customers served in the electricity sector and average monthly price in the US state have very different trends depending on what group they were in. Therefore, the OUTAGE.DURATION column is a more encompassing set and can be predicted in a larger scope, without needing to take into account smaller details like state and residential sector. All information provided would be of past outages and should be the most up to date data.

## Baseline Model

The baseline model that we created comprises of 5 features. These are 4 nominal categories: 'MONTH', 'NERC.REGION', 'CAUSE.CATEGORY', and 'CLIMATE.CATEGORY', and 1 quantitative category, 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED'. We one-hot encoded every nominal feature and passed through CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED, receiving a returned R^2 of about 0.06. The reason why these features are used is due to us implementing the following logic and prior discoveries: there seem to be higher outage duration during the summer, aka months June through August, which meant that the months must be crucial to predicting duration. Region and climate could have also have an effect, as different regions have different climates per month. The cause is crucial as well, as a storm outage may be more difficult to fix than an accidental or directed outage, as there is no weather preventing repairs from moving smoothly. The final feature, customers affected, should also be important, as the more customers in an area, the greater the urgency to resolve the outage. We believe that the current model may not be enough as, barring the incredibly low R^2 number, the data is not standardized for customers affected, as different regions may have a different population of customers, which is not taken into account when glancing at the unstandardized column. The column also needs more quantitative features, which are lacking in this dataset.
